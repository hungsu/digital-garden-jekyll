An overwhelming number of people report that [[Dark Souls]] and other [[Souls-like]] [[videogame]]s are so helpful for people with [[Depression]] it even brought them back from thoughts of [[Suicide]].

I don't know if this is true - I'm not currently depressed as I play through [[Elden Ring]]. But I respect many of these people and their thoughts:
