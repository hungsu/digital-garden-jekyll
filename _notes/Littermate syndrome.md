A non-scientific anecdotal term for the behavioural issues that tend to present when canine siblings (Littermates) are raised in the same household beyond the normal 8 to 10 weeks of age. Non littermate puppies may demonstrate similar effects when placed together.

## Effects of Littermate Syndrome:

-   One of the puppies always becomes shy, even when both puppies started off as bold and outgoing.
-   The shy puppy becomes increasingly withdrawn and introverted and never reaches potential
-   Often even the “bold” puppy turns out to be quite nervous and uncertain when separated
-   The puppies often become incredibly co-dependent, exhibiting high anxiety when separated
-   They often fail to bond to their human family as strongly as they otherwise would, if at all.
-   At social maturity, these puppies may begin fighting with one another, often quite severely.
-   Unwillingness to eat alone.
-   Failure to learn how to communicate, play, and socialize with other dogs. Over time, this can result in fear and aggression when they’re exposed to other dogs.
-   Training is more difficult. A puppy seeing the other getting rewarded may feel entitled to the same. Potty training cannot be attributed directly to one pup unless a human witnesses the action, pups will have trouble learning their names, etc.

After two years of living apart, siblings adopted by different pet parents are no longer able to recognize each other.

## How to mitigate littermate syndrome

> It was known and we had a game plan. Even with that preparation, I spent the first two weeks crying on the kitchen floor, they were SO hard. Two is HARD
> ―WhoopsieWoodles

- Acknowledge that the training will be difficult. You will be embarrassed and want to quit at times.
- When entering and exiting the home, with or without dogs, don’t make a scene. Arrivals and departures should never be a with higher energy, raised voices, or big greetings. It’s strictly a human thing to hello and goodbye in that way and feeds separation anxiety.

- Let pups sleep separately.
- Treat the pups as individuals - train them out of earshot of the other.
- Provide mental stimulation
	- > We also learned that mental work is way more valuable than letting them run. So, we have a muffin tin that has food and tennis balls/toys on top. They have to move the toys to get the food. We also have snuffle mats, so they have to work to eat there. We also separate them in the house and do scatter feeding, so they have to work ON THEIR OWN to scavenge for food.
