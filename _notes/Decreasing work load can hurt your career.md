> However, my sense is that most knowledge workers employed by a company based on the “# of billable hrs = profits” model would have a hard time defending this “20% less” rule.

> Leaders have a responsibility to devote most of their time to their organizations...Would you like to see the CEO of your company, or the governor of your state, or the president or prime minister of your country, decrease their time by 20%? Leaders do not just have *jobs*, they have *ownership* of their roles, and many people depending upon them. What they can accomplish in their roles, the value they can create, is theoretically infinite and cannot be defined by the hours on a clock.

> a person wanting to progress their career in academia must work just as hard as they physically can, not to improve their output, but to outwork their neighbor colleague. It is a brutal competition, but there is simply no way around it in a zero-sum game. No matter how fast the runners run, there will be only one who gets a gold medal. Being the second is not much different than being the last.
