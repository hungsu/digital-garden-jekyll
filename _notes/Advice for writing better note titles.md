title: Advice for writing better note titles
---

Given a document, note or document within a [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system, how do we write a good and useful title? 

Outcomes we want:

- Search. One should be able to find a note again by searching for it's Title, rather than its contents.
- Accuracy and Honesty. Inaccuracy is a form of dishonesty. [[Titles are a promise of good content]].
- Clarity. We should be able to parse a title easily and quickly to determine if it is the note we want. Milliseconds matter.  [[Concise writing takes longer to write, but is worth it]].

Given these outcomes, it's worth being aware that the goals and process for writing titles for Notes have very little resemblance to writing [[Headline]]s for Stories, Titles for Blog Posts, or Subject Lines for Emails. It in some ways resembles writing titles for [[Essay]]s.

## Guidelines (not rules)

**Write the document**. Titles tend to emerge from the document as it is written. Sticking to the title keeps the note [[Atomic notes|atomic]] and honest. You may realise on writing the body, you cannot deliver on the promise of your original title. Changing the title then becomes obvious.

**Write in assertive positive form**. “X causes Y” is usually better than “X fails to do Z”. For example:

- Bad: *Doom scrolling doesn't make you smarter*
- Good: *Doom scrolling makes you stupid*

In writing this way you may also learn to be more assertive and sure of yourself.

**Phrase unproven notes as questions**. Despite my previous advice to be assertive, if you cannot prove something beyond your own doubts, you should phrase it as a question.

- Bad: *Privilege is inherited*
- Good: *How much ability is heritable?*

> ⚠ Be wary of question marks in filenames. You may have to omit them.

**Use consistent and correct spelling**. I have been tempted many times to ignore spelling errors, but this will bite you in future when you attempt to use the search feature in your notes. Take the time to use a spellchecker and fix errors. For the same reason, you should use only a single region's spelling. Don't mix American and Australian English.

**Consider characters you can't type**. I am unable to easily type  *“Gonçalo”*. So my note for such a person has an alias *“Goncalo”*.

**Look at similar notes**. One way to find them is in a [[Taxonomy of note types]]. You may notice interesting and useful conventions, such as *How To* guides beginning with the words *“How to–”*.

## Anti guidelines

These are guidelines I've seen recommended by others, which I believe you should approach with great caution.

**Move important words earlier**. What is important in one circumstance may not be in another. Consider
- Front end codebases should not use Typescript
- Typescript should not be in front end codebases

You can waste a great deal of time without progressing here.

**Arbitrary title length limits**, such as "Keep titles under 10 words". have been a waste of time in my experience. Yes, it can be argued there is great satisfaction in reducing a title down to a catch-phrase or concept-handle like length. Where we waste time is the number - hours can be lost musing whether the number is 10 or 12, or if a very complex title can be honed down sufficiently.

**Use Numbers**. Some believe that numbers in titles makes them more interesting and assertive. I believe them to be clickbait-y and low class. Consider these examples:

- 73 thoughts I had while watching Game of Thrones
- 11 ways to build muscle and lose fat

They reek of lower class writing, and are also not very Searchable. Who can remember to search for the number "73"? And every time we change the body we have to update the number!
