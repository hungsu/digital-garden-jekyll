An adversary in [[videogame]]s, much larger than the player. No firm rules exist for their size, but it seems reasonable to think they should be at least as large as a truck. More typically they are as large as geographic features such as an island or hill, and thus can be large enough for the player to climb, walk, or even run on. Thus, they make excellent centrepieces or climaxes in videogames.

The first colossal boss I ever encountered was likely one of the Weapons in [[Final Fantasy VII]].

The size of a colossal boss introduces some challenges for the game designers. If not handled properly, they can be highly frustrating and unenjoyable. 
- They need special Camera considerations. In the screenshot above, the [[Elden Ring]] Fire Giant has no special camera which often results in the player being able to see just the giant's feet without seeing its attacking arms.
