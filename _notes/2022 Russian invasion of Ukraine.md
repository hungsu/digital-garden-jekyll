**Sources I've rejected**
- Most US news sources, which frequently spin world stories to promote US politics
- Social media, including but not limited to Twitter, Youtube, Reddit, Facebook. All these platforms contain ongoing propaganda efforts from Russia and it is too difficult even for a well intentioned intelligent person to determine which sources are good.
