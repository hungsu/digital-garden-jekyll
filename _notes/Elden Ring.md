The first [[Souls-like]] game I ever played. At the time of writing I have 22 hours of logged play time, and just 2 out of 42 achievements. By far my favourite part of this game is being able to talk about it with friends and colleagues of whom many are playing it. Second of all are the game's incredible visuals, making many nods to [[Berserk]]. I don't care much so far for the game's story or characters. [[Carbot Animations]] did some hilarious spoofs
