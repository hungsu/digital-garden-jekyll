title: Titles are a promise of good content
---
Emails, notes, articles and more all have titles, and those titles always convey a message: *Inside you will find this content*. A promise has been made, expectations are set, and if the content fails to deliver, the content, the title, and the Author have all failed.

A knowledge management system which consistently keeps its promises becomes a trustworthy asset in generating new knowledge. One that does not becomes foreign. Breaking promises repeatedly destroys Trust. If we open articles from the same source and repeatedly do not find what we expect, we distrust that source. 

By following [[Advice for writing better note titles]], a writer creates a constraint for themselves. Such a constraint improves creativity, allowing for better content, thus fulfilling the title's Promise.
