title: Backlinks should include context
---

Backlinks are becoming increasingly popular in note taking applications, such as Obsidian and Notion. But sometimes these apps fail to supply context in their backlinks and thus make them worse to use.

For example, below in Notion you can see that a page named *Caitlin Floyd* refers to the current page *Horror Movies*. But we do not know why.

<img src="/assets/notion-backlink.jpg" />

The equivalent Backlink in Obsidian would include some context, like this:

<img src="/assets/obsidian-backlink.jpg" />

By supplying some context around the Backlink, we know why the link was made, and it becomes far more interesting and useful. So much so that given the choice, one should avoid note writing applications that do not include context, and opt for ones that do, such as Logseq.

Regardless, it is also helpful for the note to have a good title so that we do not have to rely entirely on the context. [[Titles are a promise of good content]].
