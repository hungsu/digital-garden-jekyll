title: Backlinks should include context
---

Backlinks are becoming increasingly popular in note taking applications, such as [[Obsidian]] and [[Notion]]. But sometimes these apps fail to supply context in their backlinks and thus make them worse to use.

For example, below in Notion you can see that a page named *Caitlin Floyd* refers to the current page *Horror Movies*. But we do not know why.

<img src="/assets/notion-backlink.jpg" />

The equivalent in Obsidian would look like this:

<img src="/assets/obsidian-backlink.jpg" />

By supplying some context around the backlink, it becomes far more useful.
