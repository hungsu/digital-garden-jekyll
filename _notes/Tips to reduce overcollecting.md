title: Tips to reduce overcollecting
---

Many of us overcollect, and we know overcollecting is bad. [[Bookmarks bring misery]], [[Overcollecting contributes to impostor syndrome]]. Thankfully I'm starting to uncover some tactics to reduce overcollecting, that seem to work.

**Open your own notes at random**. The *Open Random Note* feature in Obsidian is probably the most important tool for me to do my own thinking and refine and expand my writing. I click this many times a day, and more importantly, after hitting the button I follow up with editing, deleting, linking and thinking on what I find. If I didn’t do that, this habit would be less useful.

**Decrease the startup time on my notes app**. I noticed that opening a browser and a news page is much faster than opening Obsidian, so it’s unsurprising I would look at so much news. I turned off all plugins on the Obsidian app, only enabling them temporarily when I need them, and turning them off after. This may seem a pain, but having that fast startup 100% of the time is worth some hassle 5% of the time. Dovetailing from that…

**Publishing my notes**. Reading my notes online is much faster than starting Obsidian. Not only that, I can set my browser home page to my published notes to revisit them much more often. I disagree philosophically with the official Obsidian Publish solution, so I use [this solution by Maxime Vaillancourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

**Add more energy** We can learn from clickbait articles and major media platforms. They are well designed to draw and keep attention. If you have felt yourself losing hours and hours drawn to colourful and exciting media, and unattracted to your own notes, then you have felt the effect of your primal brain being seduced! Observe below, I have noticed it’s very easy to lose myself in all the energy and scrolling panes of content.

You can learn from those overengineered media sources and add to your own notes, possibly in the form of:

-   more interesting note titles. Would you rather read: “Collector’s Fallacy” or “Overcollecting kills brain cells and decreases your energy”? (long note titles are quite effective)
-   more pictures. many many more pictures. In particular, take your own photos!
-   mix up your formatting! Bold, italic, different headings, dividing lines, tables are there to help you!

Dovetailing from that again…

**Enable the Backlinks in note feature**. I found that when my backlinks are in the status bar, or sidebar, I didn’t look at them as much. Embedding them in the note lures me to look at my notes much more.
