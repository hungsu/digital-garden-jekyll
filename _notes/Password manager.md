A password manager is a safe place to store passwords.

I actively use Bitwarden and 1Password. I like Bitwarden because itself can be configured to require a password and [[Security key]].

Password managers I've rejected:
- Keepass. It works, but is ugly and hard to use.
- Post it notes on your computer
- A notebook of passwords
- A text file
- An email inbox

In addition or instead of a password manager, one could try a Password algorithm.
