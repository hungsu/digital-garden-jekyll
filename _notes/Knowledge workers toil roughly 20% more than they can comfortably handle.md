title: Knowledge workers toil roughly 20% more than they can comfortably handle
---


Since knowledge workers self regulate their workload, they default to a simple strategy: start saying “no” when they feel stressed. The problem with this strategy, is that they don’t start pulling back until _after_ we have too much going on: leading to the 20% overload that’s so consistently observed.

Assuming this is true, rather than the common 40 hour work week, knowledge workers should consider a [[5-hour work day]] or [[Four day work week]]. But one must be wary, [[Decreasing work load can hurt your career]]
