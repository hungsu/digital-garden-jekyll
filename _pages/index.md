# The notes of Hung-Su

2022-02-26: In response to news of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], I found myself doomscrolling and getting angry at propaganda.

2022-02-25: Someone potentially implied I have terrible [[Technical writing]] skills, so I've been thinking about that, along with things from the last update

2022-02-19: I started a new job recently, thus I'm thinking a bit about:
- [[The first 100 days at a new job]]
- [[Cybersecurity]]
- [[EmberJS]]
- [[Monorepo|Monorepos]]

My dogs are also giving me a lot of trouble, thus I'm researching [[Littermate syndrome]] and looking for advice on [[Training a reactive dog]].
